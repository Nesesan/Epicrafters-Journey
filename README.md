# Epicrafters-Journey

Epicrafter's Journey is a Java-based project designed to explore foundational game mechanics such as resource management, crafting, and construction. It introduces players to a modular block system and basic gameplay dynamics.

**Features**
* Starter Kit System: Provides players with a predefined set of blocks to inspire creativity and jumpstart building ideas.
* Building System: Allows players to experiment with different types of blocks and create custom structures.
* Logging: Uses Apache Log4j 2 for tracking game events and debugging.

**Development Tools and Techniques**

Programming Language
* Java 21: The project takes advantage of the latest Java features to ensure modern, efficient, and scalable code.

Core Features Used
* Lambda Expressions: Simplifies the codebase by using functional programming for concise and readable logic.
* Interfaces: Enables modular and flexible design, supporting future extensibility.
* Enums: Used to define block types and other fixed constants in a clean and type-safe manner.
* Collections Framework: Implements dynamic data structures such as List, Map, and Set for managing blocks and resources efficiently.
* Virtual Threads: Leverages Java 21's virtual threads to handle concurrent tasks with minimal overhead, making the application responsive and performant.

Logging Framework
* Apache Log4j 2: Provides robust logging for tracking key events, errors, and debugging information.
* Configured with a custom layout to display log levels, timestamps, and thread details.
